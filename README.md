    Connect Speaker
</h1>

A small app for conveniently connecting to or disconnecting from a Bluetooth speaker which is already on.

Place the widget onto your home screen to connect or disconnect the selected speaker with a single tap. Alternatively, open the app and use the "Toggle Connection" button.

This is based on the [BOOM Switch](https://github.com/Shingyx/BoomSwitch) app but instead connects/disconnects any kind of Bluetooth speaker, provided that it is already paired and powered on. You will only find this app useful if you find it inconvenient to go to the phone's Bluetooth settings to do this manually. Please use BOOM Switch instead if you use a UE BOOM speaker and want to power it on and off as well.
